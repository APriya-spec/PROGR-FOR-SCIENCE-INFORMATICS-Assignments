Description: 
Using techniques to extract the DNA sequence from the file, retrieve certain nucleotide positions, compute the reverse complement, and determine nucleotide counts inside each kilobase area of the sequence, we analyse the DNA sequence from a chromosomal file (chr1_GL383518v1_alt.fa) for this assignment. The script also calculates the total number of nucleotides per kilobase, which gives information about how nucleotides are distributed throughout segments. The ability to read sequence files, operate with DNA sequences, and summarise nucleotide distributions by kilobase is demonstrated in this study.

Requirements
•	Download the chr1_GL383518v1_alt.fa file from UCSC Genome Browser.
•	Install R on your system.

Steps to Execute the Script
1.	Save the R script (assignment.R) to your local system.
2.	Open a terminal or R console.
3.	Navigate to the directory where the file is saved using the cd command if using a terminal.
4.	Run the script in R by executing the following command:
source("assignment.R")
