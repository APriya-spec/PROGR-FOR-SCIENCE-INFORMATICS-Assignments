# **Assignment 5 | Advanced R**

### **Programmer Name: Aruna Priya Cheekatla**

Language of the script: R

Date: 11/24/2024

### **Description:** 
The goal of this study is to find genes that are differentially expressed (DEGs) between tumor and normal samples by analyzing gene expression data. Data loading from several files, phenotype-based column renaming, phenotype-based data splitting, average expression computation, and log2 fold change computation are important processes. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is carried out using histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps for visualization, and DEGs with substantial fold change are identified. Their expression levels in tumor or normal samples are also determined.

### **Requirements:** 
•	Download the following files:
Gene_Expression_Data.xlsx, Gene_Information.csv, Sample_Information.tsv.

•	Install R on your system.


### **Steps to execute the script:** 
1. Launch a R terminal or RStudio.
2. Gene_expression_analysis.R is a script file that you should save locally.
3. Use setwd() to set the working directory in R to the location of the data and script files.
4. Enter source("gene_expression_analysis.R") to launch the script.
