### **PROGRAMMER NAME: Aruna Priya Cheekatla**

### **SCRIPT LANGUAGE: Python** 

### **DATE: 10/12/2024**

### **DESCRIPTION:**
This Python application examines gene expression information from both normal and tumour samples. It computes fold changes for each gene between the tumour and normal groups after processing data from several sources (Excel, CSV, and TSV). It then filters for important genes whose fold changes are more than 5. To visualise gene expression and spot trends, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is also included in the analysis.

### **REQUIREMENTS:**
Python libraries: Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, fastcluster. 

### **FILES NEEDED:** 
Gene_Expression_Data.xlsx, Sample_Information.tsv, Gene_Information.csv

### **STEPS FOR EXECUTING THE SCRIPT:**
1. Download all the needed files and upload them in Python directory.
2. Run the Python script.
3. Script will load the data files, which are needed to be processed. Visualizations like heat maps, histograms, clustermaps, bar graphs are generated.
