### **Description:** 
This Unix script is intended to retrieve all secondary assemblies for human chromosome 1 from the UCSC Genome browser, unzip them, create a new file, and append detailed information about the downloaded files. Ultimately, all the chromosome data we need would be added to a specific file. 

### **Requirements:** 
wget (for downloading chromosome 1 assemblies from the UCSC genome browser, I installed wget 1.21.5 version, Gunzip (to unzip all of the downloaded chromosome 1 assemblies).

### **Steps to execute the script:** 
1. Download the repository to the system and name it UnixASG.sh
2. Opened the terminal window.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved using the 'cd' command.
4. To run the script use ./UnixASG.sh
   
### **Generated files:**
Informatics_573 ( all downloaded and unzipped chromosome assemblies are stored) and data_summary.txt (contains a list of files, the first 10 lines of each file, the name of the file, and the total number of lines it contains).
